# Database Transformation Playbook Lessons Learned 

The intent of this case study is to share the challenges that surfaced and the steps we took to mitigate and/or resolve those challenges. We hope to save teams valuable time during their database migration journeys! 

<br>

##Context 
Database migration is not a simple task and GSA fully understands the challenges and complexities that accompany such an effort. For this reason, we hope this document will help teams **proactively identify and mitigate challenges**. GSA recently completed a 6 month pilot for migrating databases from proprietary software to open source software. A high level description of the project can he found on the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) website under <a href="https://tmf.cio.gov/projects/#application-modernization-integrating-flexible-architectures">Application Modernization Integrating Flexible Architectures</a>. GSA conducted an end of phase retrospective with all team members and represents the basis for this document.
