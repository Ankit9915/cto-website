# Database Transformation Playbook Lessons Learned 

The intent of this case study is to share the challenges that surfaced and the steps we took to mitigate and/or resolve those challenges. We hope to save teams valuable time during their database migration journeys! 

<br>

##Context 
Database migration is not a simple task and GSA fully understands the challenges and complexities that accompany such an effort. For this reason, we hope this document will help teams **proactively identify and mitigate challenges**. GSA recently completed a 6 month pilot for migrating databases from proprietary software to open source software. A high level description of the project can he found on the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) website under <a href="https://tmf.cio.gov/projects/#application-modernization-integrating-flexible-architectures">Application Modernization Integrating Flexible Architectures</a>. GSA conducted an end of phase retrospective with all team members and represents the basis for the information shared throughout this document.

##Team Construct 
GSA IT did not assemble a dedicated team for planning, project management and implementation. Instead, GSA IT employed a matrix team structure with representation from 3 primary GSA IT business lines (which also represented the development team), budgeting, enterprise and cloud infrastructure, database and middleware, security, privacy, enterprise architecture and the office of the chief technology officer - a total of about 20 team members.   


##What went well
###Product Management: 
Team members from the office of the chief technology officer facilitated product management activities, coordination and overall monitoring and status reporting to GSA IT leadership, the TMF PMO office, and OMB. The Pilot Phase meeting cadence consisted of 1 weekly 30 minute stand up with the overall team and 1 bi-weekly 45/60 minute session with each of the development teams.  
* The 30 Minute weekly stand ups were helpful for sharing information and statuses across the team. It provided a consistent and recurring means for each team to interact directly with other teams to coordinate tasks, clear blockers, and further define requirements and dependencies.
* The bi-weekly 45/60 minute sessions provided each of the development teams the opportunity to meet with team members providing core-IT services from security, enterprise infrastructure, enterprise architecture, database and middleware, privacy, and cloud services. Each of the support staff had an opportunity to clarify requirements and dependencies to ensure tasks were well understood. 

* In addition, the team operated on a two week sprint cycle and consolidated activities on a master Trello  board to tracking tasks.        

###Budget and Contract Support:
Dedicated budget support was essential for tracking budget execution activities and contracting actions. GSA IT did not execute a new contract for database transformation, much of the technical and support related work were already in scope throughout several GSA IT contracts. By leveraging existing contracts, GSA IT was able to begin work shortly after the TMF Board awarded the initial disbursement of funds.
