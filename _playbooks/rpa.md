# Robotic Process Automation 

**Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** is a business process automation technology that automates manual tasks that are largely **rules based, structured and repetitive** using software robots, also known as **bots**. A RPA tool maps a process for a robot to follow which allows the bot to operate in place of a human.

## GSA RPA Bots
The General Services Administration has made the **code accessible through GitHub** for those looking to get started or learn more about RPA. The code powers a few of GSAâ€™s bots that are currently being used by various teams.

## Why RPA?

RPA enables employees to spend less time on routine tasks and focus more on challenging tasks on hand. RPA allows for:

- Better Customer Experience
- Minimal Error Rates
- Better Management Capabilities
- Transactional to Analytical Culture

RPA also aligns with the President's Management Agenda (PMA) for IT Modernization.

## RPA Guide

U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has worked with the Office of the Chief Finance Officer (OCFO) to develop a RPA guide that sets standards and best practices that RPA teams should use when implementing RPA. 

## RPA Community of Practice

[RPA Community of Practice (CoP)](https://digital.gov/communities/rpa/) is a government-wide initiative led by GSA's OCFO and Technology Transformation Services (TTS) to facilitate collaboration and problem solving between federal agencies that are interested in implementing RPA. The CoP shares information and resources and provides guidance for RPA implementation and operations. Government employees can join the FedRPA CoP by sending an email to [FedRPA-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov](mailto:FedRPA-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov).
