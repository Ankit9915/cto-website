This playbook is designed to assist federal agencies as they **start Technology Business Management (TBM)** implementation. While each agency should tailor its TBM implementation to their organization’s current state and desired outcomes, the playbook **offers guidance and lessons learned** from the **U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Department of Education**.

Each play here is a plan of action or strategy used to move toward a goal or objective. **The 7 plays in this book will improve your chances of beginning a successful TBM implementation.**

## The TBM Basics

TBM is a **methodology designed to communicate the value of information technology** to agency stakeholders. TBM focuses on **cost transparency, delivering value, identifying the total cost of IT**, and **shaping demand for IT services**.

To gain alignment between IT, finance, and business stakeholders, TBM provides a standard taxonomy with three different perspectives:

* **Finance View:** The lowest layer of the model begins with the general ledger. It has cost pools such as hardware, software, and labor.
* **IT View:** The middle layer includes a set of IT towers and sub-towers, such as servers, storage, and applications.
* **Business View:** The taxonomy provides a standard set of application and service categories along with higher-layer business units and business capabilities.

## Why TBM?

TBM is a way to manage IT like a business, support value conversations, maximize the benefit achieved through IT spending, and align with business needs and strategy.

Some key benefits of TBM include:

* Optimizing uses of funding and rationalizing portfolios such as platforms, applications and vendors
* Aligning technology spending and investments to business priorities
* Discussing budget in terms that business partners can understand
* Shifting IT into the role of a service broker instead of an order taker
* Reflecting total costs with supporting detail
* Providing a better understanding and method to communicate the IT budget to customers
* Supporting Federal efforts to promote cost transparency and improve IT management

## The 7 plays...

**1) Identify key players and stakeholders**

An effective TBM program consists of business stakeholders, financial analysts, and IT and acquisition professionals. Together, this team drives change through collection, analysis, reporting, and informed review of IT data.

**2) Determine current state**

To understand what the TBM journey will look like for your agency, it’s necessary to understand current data collection and aggregation methods, financial systems, business processes, and models your agency already has to support TBM. No matter your current state, TBM can bring value.

**3) Identify measurable desired outcome**

Identify how your agency can deliver the right IT services for the best possible price as you work with stakeholders to identify priority areas to focus your TBM efforts.

**4) Start aligning data**

Based on your agency’s current state and desired near term outcomes, it’s time to start working with financial data. Starting from the bottom up is recommended - aligning financial data to cost pools before moving to tower and service mapping.

**5) Look for insights**

Now that you have started mapping your data, where does that data lead you? Focus on examining the data to see how it provides insights into issues or benefits around the identified outcomes.

**6) Rollout and adoption**

Now that you have completed the first iteration of your TBM implementation, start integrating TBM principles, data, and value discussions into meetings and funding reviews.

**7) Keep maturing the TBM implementation**

Assess your maturity and identify opportunities to maximize your TBM implementation.
