<h1>What is Cloud Strategy?</h1>

<h2> Why Do We Care?</h2>

<h3>What do we mean by cloud?</h3>

<p>The cloud is any software or service run on the internet (rather than on your local computer)
    cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through
    cloud services via the internet. Any individual pays for the cloud per consumption.
</p>

<p>
    Key characteristics of the cloud are: <strong>Flexibility, Elasticity, Agility, and Scalability</strong>
</p>

<h3> OMB's Cloud-first & Open Source Memos</h3>

<p> 
    The OMB policy does not specifity approaches to using the cloud, only that the cloud should be used. 
    We want to maximize our investment in modernization and the cloud by focusing on improving our implementations, 
    getting ride of technical debt, and increasing our ability to deliver quality, safe software
</p>

<p>
    We should not move things into the cloud just for the sake of moving to the cloud. We need to see visible 
    improvements to the capabilities. Your cloud strategy should not generally be treated as a 'cost play.' Although there are 
    absolutely cases in which going to teh cloud will save money. But much of the time, it will not. 
</p>

<p>
    However, your cloud strategy will make us better at delivery and allow ourselves to focus on business value over implementation details.
