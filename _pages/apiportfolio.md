# GSA API Management Shared Services Portfolio

GSA is developing an IT shared services strategy to improve the delivery of common IT capabilities to support GSA’s mission. Our goal is to reduce IT costs, increase collaboration across the delivery teams, and enhance the overall customer experience.

The API Management Portfolio is one of GSA IT’s Shared Services Portfolios.  This group is key to the Internal Engagement and Technical Architecture pillars of the [GSA API Strategy](/guides/API_strategy). The Portfolio includes representatives from organizations in GSA IT.

The group meets monthly, and has the following initial goals and objectives:

- Develop centralized directory of non-public APIs  
- Perform API Technology analysis
- Develop an Internal Marketing/Communications Campaign
- Expand reviewers of API Standards in GSA IT Offices
- Develop Non-Public/Internal API Guides
