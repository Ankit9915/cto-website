### API Strategy Implementation Approach

GSA promotes an API-first approach for making its solutions optimal for data transparency, data consumer engagement, application development, and the like. This assists with opening systems and data sets for further system integration by allowing the movement of data from legacy systems for use and design of new solutions via new open technologies.

We are adopting industry best practices with API design, development, and management. Our approach to APIs is found in our [API Strategy]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/downloads/GSAAPIStrategy.pdf).

The CTO Office is implementing this strategy using the following Three pillars:

### Pillar 1: External Customer Experience

Providing APIs that fulfill the needs of customers and design the user experience from their perspective, instead of technology-focused perspective. The GSA API Directory and API documentation is the primary method of implementing this.

### Pillar 2: Internal Engagement

Building a community of API owners and practitioners inside GSA to develop APIs in a consistent fashion. The GSA API Standards and GSA API Working Group are two key components of this pillar.

### Pillar 3: Technical Architecture

Designing technology solutions that are used to implement APIs that follow the GSA API Standards. The CTO office seeks to provide recommended technical solutions for developing and hosting high quality APIs.
